// in mathematics, the factorial of a number is the product (i.e. the multiplication) of all of the integers leading up to that number, starting from 1. A factorial is written as an exclamation point !. So to calculate 5! you simply multiply 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1. That equates to 120. Easy right? The factorial of 0! or 1! always results as 1 by convention.

function factorial(num) {
	// your code goes here
  return num;
}

factorial(4); // Should return 24
